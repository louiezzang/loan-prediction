## Short Questions & Answers
Your models have been implemented and customers are now using them in production.
1. Imagine the credit risk use case above. You have two models: a logistic regression
model with an F1-score of 0.60 and a neural network with an F1-score of 0.63. Which
model would you recommend for the bank and why?

2. A customer wants to know which features matter for their dataset. They have several
models created in the DataRobot platform such as random forest, linear regression, and
neural network regressor. They also are pretty good at coding in Python so wouldn't
mind using another library or function. How do you suggest this customer gets feature
importance for their data?
